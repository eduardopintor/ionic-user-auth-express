{"name":"Ionic Authentication with NodeJS","tagline":"How to authenticate your Ionic app with NodeJS and Express","body":"# Ionic User Authentication with NodeJS\r\n\r\nFor your enjoyment this project provides a basic Ionic app and Express server with functionality for user authentication using bearer tokens, as specified by [RFC 6750](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750).\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n1. Install [npm](https://github.com/npm/npm)\r\n2. Install [Ionic CLI](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/)\r\n3. Install [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.com/)\r\n4. Install [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#getting-started) \r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n1. Download project.\r\n2. Run `npm install` in both `mobile` and `server` directories.\r\n3. Modify `conf.js` in `server` directory to connect to your MongoDB.\r\n4. Run `mongod`.\r\n5. Run `gulp` in `server` directory to start server.\r\n6. Run `ionic serve` or `ionic build ios; ionic emulate ios;` in `mobile` directory.\r\n7. Eat cookies\r\n\r\nIf using `ionic serve` I used this [solution](http://forum.ionicframework.com/t/solved-cors-with-ionic/7454/7?u=seanhill) to do HTTP requests right from the browser.\r\n\r\nThis project has not been tested in an production enviroment, so the API may not work without the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` being set properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Mobile App\r\n\r\nThe mobile app is very basic. It starts you off in a \"Welcome\" screen that has one button `Create Profile`. This transitions you into a `Create Profile` page. After creating a profile and storing the `authToken` in the device's local storage, it transitions you to a sample page where you can get a user from the protected `/api/user/get` route. You can also test the `401` server response on this page by clearing out the `authToken` and requesting a user from `/api/user/get`. This causes the mobile app to display a `Login Modal` that requires to first authenticate, and then proceeds to get the user.\r\n\r\nThanks to [KD Moore Consulting](http://www.kdmooreconsulting.com/blogs/authentication-with-ionic-and-angular-js-in-a-cordovaphonegap-mobile-web-application/) which provides a more detailed look at this process.\r\n\r\n## The Point\r\n\r\nI finally figured out how to link up my Ionic App with a backend using bearer tokens for authentication, so I wanted to provide a solution that will hopefully help you on your journey to creating mobile apps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
